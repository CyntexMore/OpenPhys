**OpenPhys** is a simple physics engine library written in **Rust**.

## Goals

Currently, my goal is to create a pretty well working 2D collision system, then, the dev branch can get merged with into the main branch. But for that to happen how I'd like it to happen, I also have to add rotation for objects, which should be pretty easy considering that we now have vertices for objects.

## Features

**OpenPhys** is early in development, a lot more features will be added in the future.

- Heat transfer simulation
- Calculate gravitational force
- Sandbox (\*pretty experimental)
